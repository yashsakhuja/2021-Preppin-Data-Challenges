# 2021-Preppin-Data-Challenges
My take on Preppin' Data Challenges using Python 

The overall aim of Preppin' Data is to give people a place to learn the power of 
being able to prepare your own data sets (rather than relying on others).

The community provides solutions for data prep using Tableau Prep
but here in order to improve my python skills I try to provide similar 
solutions utilising the capabilities of python

The datasets are provided by CARL ALLCHIN, TOM PROWSE, JENNY MARTIN, JONATHAN ALLENBY 
You can find the datasets here: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/
